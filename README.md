# Images Optimization

> The inspiration for this repo comes from the `<picture>` element which offers us a bit more flexibility to serve more sensible images based on any valid media query that would normally be defined in a CSS.

## Usage

Overall this tool is rather simple. Just do your standard `npm intall`, drop some images into the `images` folder and run from the CLI. This will create two sub-folders `(optimized|resized)` containing the newly scaled and optimized images.

```bash
# Install
npm i

# Buid the images
npm start
```
